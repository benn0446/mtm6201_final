# VEGETARIAN RESTAUARNT

## Project Overview
This is the final project for the MTM6201 course. I have created a restaurant website using Bootstrap, following the high-fidelity wireframe provided in my UX Design course.

## Process
The website was designed with accessibility and responsiveness in mind. I used Bootstrap to create a responsive layout and added custom styles for animations and design tweaks. The goal was to create an engaging and user-friendly experience.

## Challenges
•⁠  ⁠The primary challenge was switching from TailwindCSS (which I initially used) to Bootstrap, as the assignment required the use of Bootstrap.
•⁠  ⁠Ensuring images were optimized for different screen sizes and using the ⁠ <picture> ⁠ tag to make them responsive.

## What I Learned
•⁠  ⁠I learned how to structure a website properly using Bootstrap's grid system.
•⁠  ⁠I also gained experience in optimizing images and improving accessibility with semantic HTML and ARIA roles.

## Assets Used
•⁠  ⁠*Bootstrap* (for the framework and components).
•⁠  ⁠*Google Fonts* (for custom fonts).
•⁠  ⁠*Unsplash* (for images used in the hero section and other parts of the website).s
